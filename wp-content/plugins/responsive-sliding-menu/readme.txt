Responsive Sliding Menu is a plugin that generates a side-opening menu shortcode. The menu is fully customizable

== Description ==
Responsive Sliding Menu allows you to generate a shortcode to integrate into your site via a page builder (Elementor, Oxygen, Divi, Gutenberg...) or via PHP.
A preview of the rendering is available in the WordPress plugin settings interface.
In particular, you can modify the colors, font sizes or even the icon of the burger menu (responsive). You can also use Elementor Widget RSM Menu to display (or not) your Responsive Sliding Menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change everything in my menu? =

In plugin v1, you can change menu colors, font sizes, mobile burger menu icon, screen size from which mobile menu will display.
It is not yet possible to modify the inside of the menu that opens sideways, but we are working on it for the next version
